  The next class work we had to do was getting some experience with MIT app
  developer. This uses a drag a drop system similar to scratch for its code. It
  has a limited scope but is good for doing proof of concepts.

**Reflection**

This class work was a good way to introduce using MIT app inventor. Which has been proven to be a good tool for prototyping projects before undertaking larger projects. It can be frustrating at times to utilize the software as the block format is a bit of an adjustment when being used to working with normal code. As well as the design elements are extremely limited in the placements offered. If you want to have any form of complex design elements you have to use the layouts feature which is cumbersome and can be frustrating at times. Overall this project has taught me the advantages of using MIT app inventor for prototyping but that seems to be all that it is good for. For any larger options or anything you want to actually publish you should be using something like android studio.

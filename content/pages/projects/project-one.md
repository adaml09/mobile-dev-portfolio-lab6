  Lab 2 was an introduction to working with XML. This was because XML would be a
  part of the mobile development we would be doing starting in android studio.

For this Lab we only had to make one XML page that was validated and rendered in the browser. It was simply meant to be an introduction to the language as it would be important later on. Here is the XML rendered in the browser.![](/images/Lab2_1.png)

here is the rest of the XML as it would not fit in one image: ![](/images/Lab2_2.png)

As mentioned before this has also been validated ensuring that it meets the XML standards, this was done on an external site.

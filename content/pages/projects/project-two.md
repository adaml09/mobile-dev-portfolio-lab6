## The mobile revolution

Due to the dawn of mobile computing becoming much more widespread, over the last decade or so, people’s lives have changed massively in many ways. The biggest advantage of this new wave of mobile devices is efficiency. This comes in many forms we are now able to contact pretty much anyone anywhere within a few clicks. If you’re in a new area and need to find your way somewhere you have a multitude of maps in your pocket ready to go. As well as with online shopping on sites like amazon you could be sitting on the beach on vacation and order yourself a new TV for when you get home. Another area that is benefited greatly by the newfound efficiency that mobile devices bring is professional space. If you’re working in pretty much ant industry now it is important to have and use a mobile device of some kind whether it is your own personal device, or one provided by your employer. In many cases the ease of use that these devices provide has become so common place that we may forget about their importance, but without their help things would run a lot slower.

This new modern world of convenience and connectivity in the palm of your hand is far from perfect though, there are many disadvantages and concerns to do with this. With many of us adults today growing up alongside this technology we might struggle to understand the state that the younger generation is in. Some of them being chronically online to the point that that’s all that matters to them. The fact that some social media apps have been designed to keep people addicted and using them does not help this issue. Many parents are concerned that their kids are reeling way too much on this new technology and aren’t having a full enough childhood.

As shown in the figure 2 table, many people spend huge amounts of time on their phones each day. With the youngest generation with a staggering 6 hours. Much of this time is being wasted on Instagram or other social media. Overuse of mobile devices and other screen time can be detrimental to your sleep as described in a HEADS UP article titled “Can too Much Screen Time Harm You?”. Affected sleep can also affect your mood and mental health. So limiting screen time is something that should definitely be a consideration especially with kids on young adults. Another issue that comes along with this is since these are just kids there are many evil people and organizations out there that are looking to take advantage of the fact that so many young impressionable minds are constantly on the internet.

This is specifically an issue with younger girls and women. Media that is forced into their faces as they spend time on the internet attempts to influence their views on how they should look or act. These posed expectations are often extremely unrealistic and can cause body image issues. According to Health Clevland Clinic, although this is mainly an issue with young girls 46% of teens aged 13 – 17 said that social media made them feel worse about their bodies. In extreme cases this can lead to depression and other serios mental illnesses.
A related issue that can be compounded with the messages spread by corporate media, is the potential of cyberbullying. This can often be even worse than regular bullying since people can feel empowered to say things they might not normally with the perceived protection of a screen and a username. Again, this can cause many teens and children to have depression and other mental health conditions. Another staggering statistic listed by the Health Clevland Clinic states that as much as 64% of teens report that they are exposed to hate content online. The main reason that makes cyberbullying such an epidemic is that you can’t escape it. The comments will always be there under that photo or post haunting it forever. This makes the weight of this harassment so much harder to bear and is also why it can lead to worse results.
Although the vast increase in mobile computing use has come with many advantages, it also has brought to light many new problems. This means that going forward we must be careful with how much we allow it to be integrated into our lives. As the short-term gains that its efficiency and convenience provide, might be overtaken by the negatives that could come along with it. That is if we allow it to run our lives instead if using the benefits provided as a tool to help us live and work better.

### Which One Would I Pick

I would pick the Google Pixel 9; the specs are sightly better in most areas compared to the I-Phone 16. In addition to this, I prefer the android OS when compared to IOS. I like the fact that it feels more customizable and there doesn’t seem to be as much smoke and mirrors.  Although IOS is very esthetically pleasing Android OS feels much more open. With IOS I feel like there is a façade that is covering up what’s really going on. This is a major reason for me to go with the Pixel 9, also the price point is a key reason why. For the same storage it is decently cheaper to go with the pixel. Along with this you do get more performance and features for your money, making the savings even better.

### Which One I Would Pick

I would pick the Rogers plan, although both plans are very competitive when it comes to what they offer, it comes down to the pricing for me. Even though they are priced the same, the bell offer is only if you are currently a bell customer, as I am not currently with bell that would make this plan much more expensive for me. So, I would be able to get the same level of service for a better price as new customer from Rogers.
